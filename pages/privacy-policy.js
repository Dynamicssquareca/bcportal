                                    <p>Business Central Partners and its affiliated services (collectively “Business Central Partners,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respect your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have. It applies to information collected through our websites, applications, and other online properties we operate (the “Sites”).</p>
                                    <p>Unless otherwise stated, Business Central Partners is the data controller for the information described in this policy. We may update this policy periodically; the “Last updated” date above shows when it was last revised. Please check this page regularly.</p>

                                    <p><b>5.1 With Content Providers and partners</b></p>
                                    <p>If you request or view third-party content (such as white papers or vendor materials) hosted or linked through our Sites, we may share your business contact details, interaction data, and relevant supplementary information with the Content Provider so they may follow up with you. If you do not want your information shared in this way, please do not request or view third-party content.</p>

                                    <p><b>5.2 Service providers</b></p>
                                    <p>We share personal data with vendors who perform services on our behalf (hosting, email delivery, analytics, payment processors, customer support, survey tools). These vendors are permitted to use data only to provide services to us.</p>

                                    <p>We may disclose information if required by law, in response to legal process, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the safety of others.</p>

                                    <p><b>5.4 Business transactions</b></p>
                                    <p>If we are involved in a merger, sale, reorganization, or transfer of assets, personal information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We will require the receiving entity to maintain privacy protections consistent with this policy.</p>

                                    <p><b>5.5 Aggregated information</b></p>
                                    <p>We may publish or share aggregated and de-identified statistics about users and usage that do not identify any individual.</p>

                                    <p><b>6. Advertising and analytics</b></p>
                                    <p>We work with third-party advertising and analytics providers who may collect non-identifying information about your visits across websites to serve targeted ads and measure ad performance. To learn about and opt out of many interest-based advertising programs, consult the privacy controls offered by those advertising networks or use your device/browser settings to limit ad tracking.</p>

                                    <p><b>7. Your choices and rights</b></p>

                                    <p><b>7.1 Marketing communications</b></p>

Transactional messages related to purchases or account management are not affected by unsubscribe requests.</p>

                                    <p><b>7.2 Access, correction, deletion, portability, objection</b></p>
                                    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may request access to, correction of, export of, restriction of, or deletion of your personal data, or object to certain processing.

                                    <p><b>8. International transfers</b></p>
                                    <p>Because we operate internationally, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries with different data protection rules. When transferring personal data from the EEA, UK or Switzerland to countries without an adequacy decision, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or other lawful mechanisms.</p>

                                    <p><b>9. Data security and retention</b></p>
                                    <p>We use administrative, technical and physical controls designed to protect personal data. While we strive to protect your data, no security measure is perfect. If a breach affecting your data occurs, we will follow applicable notification requirements.</p>
                                    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. Retention periods vary by data type and legal need.</p>

                                    <p>We do not typically collect sensitive personal data (such as health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or trade union membership). If we ever need to process those categories, we will do so only with a lawful basis and where required, explicit consent.</p>

                                    <p><b>10.3 California residents</b></p>
